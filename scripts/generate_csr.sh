# generate_csr.sh
#
# Generates a Certificate Signing Request (.certSigningRequest) suitable for
# Apple's distribution certificate flow. Runs on macOS, Linux, or Windows-WSL —
# you do NOT need a Mac for this step (despite Apple's docs).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/generate_csr.sh "you@example.com" "Common Name"
#
# Outputs (to the current directory):
#   Varisankya-key.pem    — the private key (KEEP SECRET; will be packed into .p12)
#   Varisankya.csr        — the CSR to upload at developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add
#
# Next steps (in the Apple Developer portal):
#   1. Visit https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add
#   2. Choose: Apple Distribution
#   3. Click Continue
#   4. Upload Varisankya.csr
#   5. Download the resulting `distribution.cer`
#   6. Run scripts/pack_p12.sh to combine Varisankya-key.pem + distribution.cer into a .p12
#      (which is what GitHub Secrets need)
