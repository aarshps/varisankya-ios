# Combines the private key from generate_csr.sh with Apple's signed .cer

# into the BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64 GitHub Secret.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/pack_p12.sh distribution.cer
#
# Reads:
#   Varisankya-key.pem      (the private key from generate_csr.sh)
#   distribution.cer        (the signed cert from Apple, DER or PEM)
#
# Outputs:
#   Varisankya-Distribution.p12         (the keystore)
#   Varisankya-Distribution.p12.base64  (ready to paste into GitHub Secret)
